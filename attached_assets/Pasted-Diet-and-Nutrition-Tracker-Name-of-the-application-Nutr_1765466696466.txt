Diet and Nutrition Tracker

Name of the application: “NutriLog: Smart Diet Tracker”
Introduction (The Real-World Problem):
Many people struggle to achieve their health and fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance) because they lack a clear, simple-to-understand picture of their daily nutritional intake. Manual tracking is time-consuming, logging food is often tedious and complex, and it's difficult to get actionable feedback. This leads to user frustration, inconsistency, and abandonment of health goals.
Objectives (What the App Aims to Achieve):
To simplify logging: Create the fastest, most intuitive meal-logging experience possible to minimize user friction.
To provide clarity: Offer immediate, visual feedback on a user's daily intake (calories, macros) against their established goals.
To motivate and guide: Deliver actionable feedback and progress insights that help users understand their habits and make healthier choices, transforming raw data into a personal guide.
Features:
Core Features:
User Profile & Goal Setting: Onboarding process to capture user (age, weight, height, sex), activity level, and primary goal (lose, maintain, gain).
Automated Target Calculation: Automatically sets daily calorie and macronutrient targets based on the user's profile and goals.
Food Logging:
Barcode Scanner: Instantly log packaged goods.
Food Database Search: A comprehensive database of generic foods, branded products, and restaurant items.
Manual Entry: "Quick Add" calories or manually create a custom food item with full nutrition.
Daily Dashboard: A clear, visual homepage showing calories eaten vs. goal, a breakdown of macros (protein, carbs, fat), and a water-tracking utility.
Chosen Additional Features:
Recipe Builder: Allows users to input ingredients for a home-cooked meal, calculate the nutrition per serving, and save it for future logging.
Weekly Progress Report: A simple report (delivered via notification or an in-app card) that summarizes the user's consistency, highlights successes ("You hit your protein goal 5 out of 7 days!"), and shows their weight trend.
Technology Stack (Proposed):
Mobile App (Frontend): React Native (or Flutter). This allows for a single codebase for both iOS and Android, speeding up development.
Backend API: Node.js with Express. A fast, scalable, and popular choice for building RESTful APIs to handle data.
Database: SQLite. A robust, relational database perfect for structuring user data, food logs, and saved recipes. This is ideal for a self-contained application and simplifies deployment.
Food Database API: Edamam or FatSecret API. I will rely on a third-party service for the massive food database and barcode lookup, as building this from scratch is not feasible.
Cloud Services: AWS (Amazon Web Services) or Google Firebase.
Firebase is excellent for rapid development, offering authentication, database (Firestore), and hosting in one platform.
AWS provides more long-term power and flexibility (e.g., S3 for image uploads, RDS for PostgreSQL, EC2 for the backend).
Design Documents
System Architecture Diagram:
The plan is to create a diagram illustrating a client-server architecture:
The Mobile Client (React Native) is the user's interface.
It communicates with our Backend API (Node.js) over HTTPS.
The Backend API is the "brain." It handles all business logic:
It authenticates users.
It fetches/writes user data (profiles, goals, saved recipes) to our PostgreSQL Database.
It queries the Third-Party Food API (Edamam) for food searches and barcode data.
It saves all logs (meal entries, water intake) to the PostgreSQL Database.
Database Schema (Basic ER Diagram):
I will design a schema centered around the user and their logs. The key tables (collections) will be:
Users:
user_id (Primary Key)
email, password_hash
profile_data (JSON/object: age, weight, height, goal, etc.)
calorie_goal, protein_goal, carb_goal, fat_goal
MealLogs:
log_id (Primary Key)
user_id (Foreign Key to Users)
food_name
calories, protein, carbs, fat
serving_size
meal_type (e.g., "Breakfast", "Lunch")
created_at (Timestamp)
CustomRecipes:
recipe_id (Primary Key)
user_id (Foreign Key to Users)
recipe_name
total_servings
nutrition_per_serving (JSON/object)
WaterLogs:
water_log_id (Primary Key)
user_id (Foreign Key to Users)
amount_ml
created_at (Date)
Wireframes or Mockups:
I will sketch out the primary user flow. The key screens to design are:
Onboarding Screens (3-4):
Welcome screen.
"What is your goal?" (Lose/Maintain/Gain).
User stats (Age, Weight, Height, Activity).
"Here are your targets!" (Summary screen).
Home Dashboard (The "Diary"):
This is the main screen.
Top: Calorie summary ("Goal" - "Food" + "Exercise" = "Remaining").
Middle: Macro breakdown (Pie chart or bars).
Bottom: Lists for "Breakfast," "Lunch," "Dinner," "Snacks" with a large "+" button for each.
A separate, simple "Water" tracker.
Logging Flow (3 screens):
Add Food Screen: Shows a search bar, a "Barcode" icon, and tabs for "Recent," "Frequent," and "My Recipes."
Search Results Screen: A list of food items matching the search.
Food Details Screen: Shows nutrition for the item, allows user to change serving size/quantity, and a final "Log" button.
